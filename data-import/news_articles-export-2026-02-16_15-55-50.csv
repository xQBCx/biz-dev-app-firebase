In this exclusive interview, Bill Mercer explains what makes Quantum Bit Code fundamentally different.</p>

<h2>A New Language Layer</h2>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Bill, in plain terms, what did you actually invent?</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> I didn't invent another app. I built a new language layer. Quantum Bit Code is a visual, geometric encoding system that can represent words, identities, messages, and eventually any structured language—human or machine—using deterministic lattice-based rules. The Biz Dev App is the platform that operationalizes that idea across business, identity, ownership, and coordination.</p></blockquote>

<h2>""Language is the Operating System of Humanity""</h2>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> You've said ""language is the operating system of humanity."" What do you mean by that?</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> Everything that governs our world runs on language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Law is language.</li>
<li>Code is language.</li>
<li>Money is language.</li>
<li>Even DNA is language.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI exposed that truth by learning to operate across all of them at once. QBC is my response: a system that treats language itself as a first-class, programmable object—something you can encode, verify, own, transmit, and secure visually and mathematically.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So where does QBC actually fit in the real world?</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> Three places immediately:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security & Encryption</strong> – QBC glyphs don't rely on prime factorization or classical key exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Identity & Ownership</strong> – A name, phrase, or statement can be encoded into a unique, verifiable shape.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong> – Because QBC is language-agnostic, it bridges text, code, visuals, and symbolic systems.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<h2>Beyond QR Codes</h2>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How is this different from something like a QR code?</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> QR codes are static pointers. QBC glyphs are <em>executable meaning</em>. A QR code says, ""Go look somewhere else."" A QBC glyph <em>is</em> the message, the key, and the proof—depending on context.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why the Biz Dev App?</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> Because invention without adoption is useless. The Biz Dev App is where people build companies, automate operations, coordinate capital, and manage identity. QBC becomes the universal encoding layer underneath all of that.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ownership of Language</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> People already own domains, trademarks, patents, NFTs, and IP fragments. I'm just making that process native to language itself. Ownership doesn't mean censorship. It means authorship, provenance, and rights.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A Semantic Blockchain</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> Not yet—but it will become one. Think of it as a <strong>semantic blockchain</strong>—blocks aren't just transactions, they're meaning.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Long-Term Vision</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bill Mercer:</strong> A world where meaning can't be silently altered, identity isn't owned by platforms, encryption doesn't depend on assumptions that quantum computers will break, and language itself becomes programmable, ownable, and interoperable.</p>
<p>QBC isn't about hiding information. It's about structuring truth in a way machines and humans can both respect.</p></blockquote>
