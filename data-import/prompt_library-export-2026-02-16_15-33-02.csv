### **Feature Blueprint: AI-Powered CRM Note Modification**

**1. Feature Title:** Enable AI Editing and Correction of Existing CRM Notes

**2. User Story:**
*   **As a** user interacting with the Biz Dev AI assistant,
*   **I want to** be able to request corrections or updates to existing CRM notes directly via chat,
*   **So that** the information in my CRM remains accurate and up-to-date without needing to manually find the note, delete it, and create a new one.

**3. Acceptance Criteria (What ""Done"" Looks Like):**
*   When a user asks to ""correct,"" ""update,"" or ""change"" a specific note, the AI must be able to identify the correct note to modify.
*   A new API endpoint/tool must be available for the AI to call, allowing the content of a specific note (`activity`) to be overwritten or amended.
*   The original note's creation date and associated contact/company should be preserved.
*   A ""Last Modified"" timestamp should be added or updated on the note to maintain an audit trail.
*   The AI must confirm with the user that the correction has been successfully applied after the action is complete.
*   The system must handle cases where the specified note cannot be found, with the AI reporting this back to the user gracefully.

**4. Proposed Technical Implementation (Blueprint for Developers):**

A new function should be added to the `default_api` available to the AI model.

**New Tool Definition:**

```python
def update_crm_note(
    note_id: str,
    new_content: str,
    correction_reason: str | None = None
) -> dict:
  """"""
  Updates the content of an existing CRM note (activity) given its unique ID.

  This function directly modifies the text content of a previously logged
  note, preserving its original creation date and associations while updating
  a '''last_modified''' timestamp.

  Args:
    note_id: The unique identifier of the note/activity to be updated.
    new_content: The full, new text content that will replace the old content.
    correction_reason: A brief explanation of why the note is being changed.

  Returns:
    A dictionary confirming the success or failure of the update.
  """"""
```

**Backend Logic:**
1.  The function receives a `note_id` and `new_content`.
2.  It looks up the corresponding record in the `Activities` or `Notes` table.
3.  If the `note_id` is valid, it replaces the content/description field with `new_content`.
4.  It updates a `last_modified_utc` timestamp field on the record to the current time.
5.  It logs the `correction_reason` in an activity log or history table for audit purposes.
6.  It returns a `{""status"": ""success"", ""message"": ""Note successfully updated.""}`.
7.  If the `note_id` is not found, it returns `{""status"": ""error"", ""message"": ""Note ID not found.""}`.
