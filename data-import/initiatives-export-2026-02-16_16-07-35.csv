I want to challenge the stigma that you should not do business with family or friends. With tools that are available these days, especially like those in the Biz Dev App including the deals room, zero trust Deals can be created, this can lead to more vulnerability, but prosperity in that it will create a mindset of abundance instead of paranoia, distrust, scarcity. Help me articulate why the Biz Dev App can help with all of this. Whether it is valuable for parents and kids to share their wisdom from their generations, or parents want to teach their kids how to take over their business or families want to do business the members of their family or other families, I want us to figure out a curriculum that can be used in a workshop where I can be present but also that is digital and gives people the tools via the Biz Dev app to learn and run with their goals and dreams, we help them structure that initiative. The goal on our end is to help with everything I just described but also start adding users to the Biz Dev app and it will lead to an amazing ecosystem. We need to partner with Majida Baba, Create curriculum, handle registrations, and track outcomes;;scaffolding;workshop;"{""companies"":[],""contacts"":[],""deal_rooms"":[],""tasks"":[],""workflows"":[]}";"{""curriculum"":[],""emails"":[],""proposals"":[]}";{};[];0;;;2026-01-17 20:15:09.194846+00;2026-01-17 20:15:09.194846+00
